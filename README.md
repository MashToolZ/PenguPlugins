# Custom PenguPlugins Development Environment

If you plan to use this environment, make sure to change your `PenguLoader/plugins` folder path in the `tsup.config.ts` for hot-reloading.
Please keep in mind this will `clear the entire plugins folder` when you use it, so either disable the `clean` property in the config or back your plugins up somewhere.
